# final-project
1) For my final project, I'm going to create a dice roller program. It will be a six sided dice that randomly selects a number to roll. I'm going to try to make it so the dice actually rolls rather than just pick a random number.
2A) The first function will make the dice roll
2B) The second function will pick a random number
2C) The third function will keep the dice rolling
